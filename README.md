## Salary-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression-

This project builds a simple machine learning model to help an HR department predict employee salaries based on three factors: years of experience, written test score, and interview score. The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values and converting experience from text to numerical form before training a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn. The trained model is then used to predict salaries for new candidates based on their profiles.

## Question

In the exercise folder hiring.csv. The data contains hiring statistics for a firm such as the candidate's experience, his written test score and personal interview score. Based on these 3 factors, HR will decide the salary. Given this data, you need to build a machine learning model for the HR department that can help them decide salaries for future candidates. Using this predict salaries for following candidates, 2 yr experience, 9 test score, 6 interview score
12 yr experience, 10 test score, 10 interview score.

## Lessons Learned

- Proper data cleaning is essential before training a machine learning model.
- Missing values (NaN) must be handled, as most ML algorithms cannot work with incomplete data.
- Categorical data (such as text-based experience levels) must be converted into numerical form for modeling.
- The number and order of features used during prediction must exactly match those used during training.
- Simple models like Linear Regression can be effective for real-world problems when data is well prepared.
